My take on various Data Science Competitions. Performing Data Cleaning, Data Wrangling, Data Analysis, and creating Machine Learning models to make predictions on real world datasets. Demonstrating Feature Engineering i.e. feature selection and feature extraction. 

List of Competitions:
1) predicting-flight-ticket-prices: MachineHack Predicting Flight Ticket Price Hackathon (Got rank #13 with a score of 94.75 on leaderboards with a simple Random Forest algorithm, leader score 95.2) 



Miscellaneous:
1) data-augmentation-on-cnn-using-keras: Classifying images into different classes on a very small dataset using Data Augmentation. Applying CNN using Keras on TensorFlow backend. 



Working on some other datasets as well, will upload them as soon as they are done.
