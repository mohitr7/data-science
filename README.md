My take on various Data Science Competitions. Performing Data Processing, Data Analysis, and creating Machine Learning models to make predictions on real world datasets. Demonstrating Feature Engineering i.e. feature selection and feature extraction. 

List of Machine Learning Competitions/Hackathons:
1) predicting-flight-ticket-prices: MachineHack Predicting Flight Ticket Price Hackathon (Got a score of 94.75 on leaderboards with a simple Random Forest algorithm, leader score 95.5) 
2) ltfs-data-science-finhack: Analytics Vidya LTFS Data Science FinHack (ML Hackathon). (Used Ensemble Learning with ANN, 
LGBM and RandomForest classifiers to get a rank in the top 8%)



Miscellaneous ML projects:
1) camera-calibration-with-opencv-python: Using OpenCV with Python to perform camera calibration. 

2) kaggle-titanic-dataset: Performing binary classification on Kaggle Titanic dataset. Using Random Forest, Logistic Regression, SVM, ANN algorithms. 

3) kaggle-dogs-vs-cats-redux: Performing binary image classification on Kaggle Dogs vs Cats Redux dataset. Using Keras to build a CNN and using Data Augmentation.



Working on some other datasets as well, will upload them as soon as they are done.
