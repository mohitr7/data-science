# predicting_flight_ticket_prices
My take on  MachineHack Predict The Flight Ticket Price Hackathon. Performing Data Cleaning, Data Wrangling, Data Analysis, and creating Machine Learning models to make predictions on real world dataset.
Used only Random Forest algorithm in this example. 
Got a score of 94.2 on the test set in the evaluation performed by MachineHack. (rank #24 at that time on the leaderboard) 
By using a much sophisticated algorithm like XGBoost or LGBM, the score can be improved by 1-2%.
