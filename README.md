My take on various Data Science Competitions/Hackathons. Performing Data Preprocessing, Data Analysis, and creating Machine Learning models to make predictions on real world datasets. Applying Feature Engineering, Deep Learning, Ensemble Learning.
Using scikit-learn for ML, Keras with TensorFlow backend for Deep Learning.

List of Machine Learning Competitions/Hackathons:
1) predicting-flight-ticket-prices: MachineHack Predicting Flight Ticket Price Hackathon (Got a score of 94.75 on leaderboards with a simple Random Forest algorithm, leader score 95.5) 
2) ltfs-data-science-finhack: Analytics Vidya LTFS Data Science FinHack (ML Hackathon). (Used an Ensemble of ANN, LGBM and 
Random Forest classifiers to get a rank in the top 6% in Vehicle Loan Default Prediction Challenge.)



Miscellaneous ML projects:
1) camera-calibration-with-opencv-python: Using OpenCV with Python to perform camera calibration. 

2) kaggle-titanic-dataset: Performing binary classification on Kaggle Titanic dataset. Using Random Forest, Logistic Regression, SVM, ANN algorithms. 

3) kaggle-dogs-vs-cats-redux: Performing binary image classification on Kaggle Dogs vs Cats Redux dataset. Using Keras to build a CNN and using Data Augmentation.



All the datasets uploaded on this repository doesn't belong to me. I have mentioned the name of the source/competition for each dataset in this 'README.md' file.
