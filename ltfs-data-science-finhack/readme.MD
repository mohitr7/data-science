This folder contains the Jupyter notebook and the dataset used by me in the Analytics Vidhya LTFS Data Science FinHack (ML Hackathon).
The training and test datasets along with a Data_Dictionary and Sample_Submission file are provided in the 'data' folder.
All the code used is in the Jupyter Notebook 'vehicle_loan_default_prediction.ipynb'.
