The folder 'vehicle-loan-default-prediction' contains the code used by me in the Analytics Vidhya LTFS Data Science FinHack (ML Hackathon): Vehicle Loan Default Prediction Challenge.
All the code is in the Jupyter Notebook 'vehicle_loan_default_prediction.ipynb'.
The training and test datasets along with a Data_Dictionary and Sample_Submission file are provided in the 'data' folder.
The datasets doesn't belong to me.

All the coding was done on Google Colab, by moving the data folder to Google Drive for easy upload on Colab.
