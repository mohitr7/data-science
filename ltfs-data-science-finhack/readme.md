The folder 'vehicle-loan-default-prediction, contains the code used by me in the Analytics Vidhya LTFS Data Science FinHack.
All the code is in the Jupyter Notebook 'vehicle_loan_default_prediction.ipynb'.
The training and test datasets along with a Data_Dictionary and Sample_Submission file are provided in the 'data' folder.
The datasets are property of LTFS and Analytics Vidhya.
