The folder 'vehicle-loan-default-prediction, contains the code used by me in the Analytics Vidhya LTFS Data Science FinHack.
All the code is in the Jupyter Notebook 'vehicle_loan_default_prediction.ipynb'.
The training and test datasets along with a Data_Dictionary and Sample_Submission file are provided in the 'data' folder.
The datasets are property of LTFS and Analytics Vidhya.

All the coding was done on Google Colab, by moving the data folder to Google Drive for easy upload on Colab.
